<li>fixed bug where expanded Databar implementation occasionally reported an AI key repeatedly. </li>
<li>fixed bug where FNC1 characters that indicated end of variable length GS1 application identifier (AI) in GS1-128 code were stripped from result. They are now encoded again as ASCI character “GS” (group separator).</li>

<h1>Scandit SDK 4.3</h1>

<h2>New Features/Better scan performance: </h2>

<ul>
<li>Support for Aztec codes</li>
<li>New Android camera control for faster camera start and better autofocus and exposure management. (Android only)</li>
<li>Significantly higher frame rate (up to 50% increased) and fixed issues with dropped camera frames. (Android only) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes/Software Updates in 4.3.3 (January 5th, 2015)  (Android only)</h2>

<h3>Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Software update to address issues when two barcode pickers were instantiated within the same app. With the new camera control in 4.3.0, the lifecycle of the two ScanditSDKListeners was not clearly defined so that the wrong of the two pickers could receive scan results via the callbacks. This is now fixed in Scandit SDK 4.3.3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes/Software Updates in 4.3.2 (December 30th, 2014) (Android only)</h2>

<h3>Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added ignoreAspectRatio implementation of Scandit SDK 4.2 and earlier to address Android issue where camera preview crop of 85% and higher turns into full image camera preview on a number of Android devices. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes/Software Updates in 4.3.1 (December 18th, 2014) (Android only)</h2>

<h3>Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Important software update to prevent (rare) crashes when Scandit SDK is not properly configured on initial start of barcode picker.  </li>
<li>Software update to fix issues with method to set custom torch icon. In 4.3.0, setting a custom torch icon did not work.</li>
<li>Software update to fix issue when setDeviceOrientation fails on Android 2.3 devices. The failure of this method call had no negative implications from a usability perspective. </li>
</ul>
